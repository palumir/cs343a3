TODO:
1. More tests (client, binder and server runs on differnt machines, same machines etc.)

2. Double check system manual, make file and read me

Done:
1. makefile
2. server can successfully register its functions into binder's database
3. binder's database is able to handle duplicate register and function overloading(I
   think)
4. binder can accept the loc_request from client and be able to send server's location 
   back to client
5. In rpc.cc:
   skeleton registeredFunctions[256];
   string functionNames[256];
   int* argTypesList[256];
   These 3 data structures should be vector/map or other data structures instead  
   of hardcoded length array
6. All functions returned correctly
7. 1 server, 1 client 
8. Memory Leak
9. 1 server, multiple clients
10.round robin
11.create more sample propgrams for testing
12.function overloading
13.multiple servers, 1 client
14. multiple servers, multiple clients
15. handle server/client failure

Function being tested:
1. rpcInit:      yes 
2. rpcCall:      yes, cannot find any bugs so far
3. rpcRegister:  yes, cannot find any bugs so far
4. rpcExecute:   yes, cannot find any bugs so far
5. rpcTerminate: yes
